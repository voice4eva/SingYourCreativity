                        <strong>Short answer: everyone.</strong> If you ever needed a break from the daily routine, then this is for you. Our workshop provides an interactive, fun environment that assists you with exploring your creativity. It helps you
                        with achieving your team-building objectives by using music as a tool and as a metaphor of your activity within your team. <i>P.S. No prior musical experience is needed.</i>
                        <hr>Creativity happens when we step out of our comfort zone and singing is a big part of the workshop. I’ll show you some tested methods of how to use your voice, but the main goal is to create a truly fun atmosphere where everyone
                        is enjoying the music which we make together.
                        <hr>We begin to learn at the very basic level. However, if some members of your group are experienced singers or if they can play a musical instrument, then this is a great place to share their talents with their peers! We also use
                        percussion, so you can go for that if you really prefer not to sing! And we adapt our techniques to your team’s particular needs.
                        <hr>There is actually one prerequisite to participate in our workshop. You must like music! But then again, everybody loves music! So, really, it is for everyone!

                        Music is in our DNA! Did you know that making sound and movement were some of <strong>humanity's first communication tools?</strong> They have shown to improve teamwork and productivity. Music has been a part of our human experience
                        since the beginning of time as one of our primordial ways of communicating and expressing our emotions.
                        <hr> In an era of virtual communication that oftentimes feels impersonal, human touch is a valuable asset. Furthermore, <strong>we need and deserve a healthy break</strong> from the pressure which is often present in the working environment.
                        <br><br>Music alleviates stress and brings back our natural ability to think positively and creatively. <strong>Two hours of a singing session will take your mind off of your daily stress</strong> because all you will be thinking about
                        is how to breathe, how to sing and how to move in harmony.
                        <br><br>Singing is an exceptional way of making music, because your body is the instrument. So, when you use it, you <strong>improve your physical and psychological health.</strong> When you sing, your much deeper breathing stimulates
                        blood circulation. Your brain and all your muscles get better oxygenated. Your internal organs are being massaged by the regular breathing movement and you start to feel light and relaxed.
                        <br><br>Yawning often accompanies this circulatory movement. It is contagious, so you automatically start yawning as soon as you see another person doing it. It relaxes your body even more. We all know that singing and dancing produces
                        positive emotions. But did you know why? Well, when you sing or dance, our brains <strong>increase the production of endorphins and serotonins, the so-called “happy hormones”. </strong>
                        <hr> During the session you will be concentrating on your breathing technique, posture, moves, the sound of your voice as well as what is that you’re singing. Without you even realizing it, any pent-up stress goes away.
                        <br><br>By participating in Sing Your Creativity, we contribute to and benefit from the positive energy which transcends amongst all of the participants. As a result we become a human orchestra made of happy, vibrant and living instruments!
                        <hr> Music evokes our positive thoughts and feelings, which in turn are replicated in our every-day interactions, creating a powerful positive energy field that surrounds us. <strong>What we do in our workshop is hugely beneficial to our relationships and engagements.</strong>

                    <div class="text-justify">
                        SYC workshop usually follows a three-phase structure:
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Vocal and body warm-up</li>
                            <li>2. Study and practice the musical repertoire</li>
                            <li>3. Feedback</li>
                        </ul>
                        <hr>We start off with breathing and stretching exercises, which are necessary for proper singing. Then we follow with the vocal warm up. We sing some easy vocals, which purpose is to stretch your vocal chords, so they don’t get strained
                        while singing during the workshop.
                        <hr>Now we are ready for the phase 2 when we learn a simple melody of a song. We always sing together, so you don’t need to stress out or be timid in any way; we are all in the same shoes. Each song is marked on a simple lead sheet,
                        so you can visually follow the melody and the rhythm. We sing this tune several times in repetition, until we are comfortable enough not to read it anymore, but sing it from memory. At some point, this repetition becomes something
                        like meditation practice. We start to feel it in our bodies and we instinctively move along with the rhythm.
                        <br><br>There are different songs to be learned. A lot of them are canons, so once the melody is learned, we can right away start to experiment with the harmonies created by singing the song in canon mode. Other songs are arranged in the
                        pol’yphony of two and sometimes three voices. These melodies are always easy to learn, so we won’t need to spend a lot of time before we can join all the lines together. Everybody practices each melody, so there is never any waiting
                        or a boring moment.
                        <br><br>Once the melody is memorized, we are ready to incorporate some easy dance moves, which are called “body percussion”. We move in certain choreography, which adds value and is perfectly adapted to the type of song, such as balancing,
                        clapping hands, tapping shoulders or knees etc. At this point, we automatically start to “groove”! The inevitable dynamics of voice vibrations in connection with body movements creates an atmosphere of jubilant wholeness. We also
                        encourage the use of percussive instruments. We provide African drums (like bongo or tabla), chimes, fiddlesticks, woodblocks or tambourines.
                        <hr>When the singing and dancing part of the workshop has concluded, we start to talk about our impressions of that session. This allows for exchanging ideas and relationship building. In my vocal-coach career, I have noticed that
                        people are often a little anxious or tired at the beginning of a singing session, and their voices sound a bit rusty. When the session ends, they are all energized and relaxed, their voices resonate and they all tend to smile more.
                        These are perfect conditions for bonding.

                            having to think about anything else than the song. Singing in the group created a joyful energy; it was nice to hear different voices unite. I think that such a workshop should last at least two hours. I enjoyed the smile of
                            the facilitator of the workshop whose attitude was lively and exciting.”
